.SH DESCRIPTION
Encoded the Unicode scalar value \f[I]cp\f[R] into the encoding form \f[I]attributes\f[R] and write the resulting code units to \f[I]buffer\f[R].
The code unit capacity of \f[I]buffer\f[R] is specified by \f[I]count\f[R].
The implementation will write the number of code units needed to encode \f[I]cp\f[R] to \f[I]count\f[R] on output.
.PP
If the capacity of \f[C]dst\f[R] is insufficient, then \f[B]UNI_NO_SPACE\f[R] is returned otherwise it returns \f[B]UNI_OK\f[R].
.PP
To ensure the \f[I]buffer\f[R] is sufficiently-sized, the following table lists the number of code units needed to encode any character within its respective encoding form.

If \f[I]buffer\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R] and \f[I]count\f[R] is zero, then the number of code units needed will be computed by the implementation and written to \f[I]count\f[R] and \f[B]UNI_OK\f[R] is returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
UNI_OK
If the character was encoded successfully.
.TP
UNI_BAD_OPERATION
If \f[I]cp\f[R] is not a Unicode scalar value, if \f[I]count\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R], or if \f[I]buffer\f[R] is \f[C]NULL\f[R] and \f[I]count\f[R] is non-zero.
.TP
UNI_NO_SPACE
If \f[C]dest\f[R] is too small.
.TP
UNI_FEATURE_DISABLED
If Unicorn was built without support for the encoding form specified by \f[I]attributes\f[R].
