.SH NAME
uni_prev \- decode the previous scalar value
.SH LIBRARY
Embeddable Unicode Algorithms (libunicorn, -lunicorn)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unicorn.h>
.PP
.BI "unistat uni_prev(const void *" text ", unisize " length ", uniattr " attributes ", unisize *" index ", unichar *" cp ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Decodes the preceding Unicode scalar value from \f[I]text\f[R] at code unit \f[I]index\f[R] and writes the result to \f[I]cp\f[R].
The \f[I]index\f[R] parameter is updated by the implementation to refer to the code unit beginning the preceding scalar.
.PP
The number of code units in \f[I]text\f[R] is specified by \f[I]length\f[R] and its encoding is specified by \f[I]attributes\f[R].
If \f[I]length\f[R] is negative then \f[I]text\f[R] is assumed to be null terminated.
.PP
This function returns \f[B]UNI_DONE\f[R] when iteration has reached the end of \f[I]text\f[R] otherwise it returns \f[B]UNI_OK\f[R] indicating there are more characters.
If the implementation detects \f[I]text\f[R] is malformed, then it returns \f[B]UNI_BAD_ENCODING\f[R].
.PP
The \f[I]index\f[R] parameter must refer to a code point boundary otherwise the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.TP
UNI_OK
If the character was successfully decoded.
.TP
UNI_DONE
If the end of \f[I]text\f[R] was reached.
.TP
UNI_BAD_ENCODING
If \f[I]text\f[R] is malformed; this is never returned if \f[I]attributes\f[R] has \f[B]UNI_TRUST\f[R].
.TP
UNI_BAD_OPERATION
If \f[I]text\f[R], \f[C]offset\f[R], or \f[C]c\f[R] are NULL.
